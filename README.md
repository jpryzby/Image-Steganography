A project that encodes/decodes text into image files

This program encodes/decodes messages into images by reading or writing the two least significant bits of every color value for each pixel in an image. This allows the user to store two characters of text per pixel in an image.

This demo is set up in such a way that the user can extract the entirety of "Harry Potter and the Socerer's stone" AND "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" from a single image.
